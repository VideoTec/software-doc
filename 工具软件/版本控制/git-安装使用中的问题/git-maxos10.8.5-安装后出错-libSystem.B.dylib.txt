git-2.2.1-intel-universal-snow-leopard
git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard

I came up with this issue because 
I installed git-2.2.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg, 
actually mavericks(10.9.x) is latter version than mountain lion(10.8.x), 
and snow-leopard is earlier than mountain lion, 
after I installed  git-2.2.1-intel-universal-snow-leopard, this issue had gone.

A bit of an old topic, 
but had the same issue with downloading the newest version of git 
and then trying to use autocomplete. 
Reinstalling using git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard from SourceForge fixed the issue!
