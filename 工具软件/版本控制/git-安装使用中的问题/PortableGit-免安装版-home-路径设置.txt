By default, git-cmd and git-bash use the directory they were started from as
the working directory when run. You can override this by passing --cd-to-home
to them, which will set the user's home directory as the working directory (as
if Git for Windows was installed).

In addition, if you set the HOME environment variable (either permanently or
for the current session only) you can make Git store the configuration files
and the cloned repositories in the directory specified in that variable. And if
you specify --cd-to-home, git-bash and git-cmd will use that as the
working directory, too. For example:

        set HOME=%cd%/home
        git --cd-to-home
will use the relative directory named home (%cd% specifies the current
directory).

HOME 目录不知道怎么修改。
再建个批处理，设置环境变量，再间接调用命令行。

常用设置：
git config --global core.quotepath false //git ls-files 目录列表里正常显示中文
git config --global core.crlf false //禁止 pull push 时，修改换行符

如果使用 免安装版本 最好设置 system 的值，
system 值保存在安装目录里，重装系统也不影响
D:\PortableGit\mingw64\etc\gitconfig
