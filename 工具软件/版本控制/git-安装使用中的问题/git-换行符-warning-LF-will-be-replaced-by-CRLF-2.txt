$ git add -- *git-proxy.txt
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in 工具软件/版本控制/git-使用中的问题/git-proxy.txt.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

这个警告真正的意思是：
The warning "LF will be replaced by CRLF" says that 
you (having autocrlf=true) will lose your unix-style LF after commit-checkout cycle 
(it will be replaced by windows-style CRLF).
Git doesn't expect you to use unix-style LF under windows.

出现这个警告的原因是：editor/IDE 的结束符模式
P.P.S. My personal preference is configuring the editor/IDE to use Unix-style endings, and 
setting core.autocrlf to false.

In vim open the file (e.g.: :e YOURFILEENTER), then

:set noendofline binary
:wq

vim 换行符设置方法

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17628305/windows-git-warning-lf-will-be-replaced-by-crlf-is-that-warning-tail-backwar

The core.autocrlf directive will 
convert all crlf to lf upon commit and 
vice versa on checkout. 
So upon commit, the mentioned warning is in fact incorrect imho

这是一个不正确的警告信息，实际不会转换

The Git-Book states Git can 
handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when you commit, 
and vice versa when it checks out code onto your filesystem. 
This means that on commit there will be a conversion to LF and never to CRLF.

So I suspect this conversion happens on a git commit 
only if said commit is part of a merge process.
