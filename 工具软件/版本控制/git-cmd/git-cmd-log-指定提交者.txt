--author=<pattern>
--committer=<pattern>

Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines 
that match the specified pattern (regular expression). 
With more than one --author=<pattern>, 
commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen 
(similarly for multiple --committer=<pattern>).
