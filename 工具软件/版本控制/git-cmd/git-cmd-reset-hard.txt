git reset --hard
this resets all uncommitted changes you’ve made in your working copy

Note that git reset <file> is short for git reset HEAD <file>.

You can use git reset without any file name to undo all due changes. 
This can come handy when there are too many files to be listed one by one.

和 git checkout . 区别：
checkout 不重置，已经add的修改，reset可以
