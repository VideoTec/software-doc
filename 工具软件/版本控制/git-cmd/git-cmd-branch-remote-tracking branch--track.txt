git branch --track l-preview origin/l-preview

会创建一个本地分支 l-preview
并且 l-preview 的 upstream 是 origin/l-preview

git branch --track branch名稱 遠端branch 

建立一個 tracking 遠端 branch 的 branch，
這樣以後 push/pull都會直接對應到該遠端的branch。

-t
--track
When creating a new branch, set up branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge configuration entries to mark the start-point branch as "upstream" from the new branch. This configuration will tell git to show the relationship between the two branches in git status and git branch -v. Furthermore, it directs git pull without arguments to pull from the upstream when the new branch is checked out.

This behavior is the default when the start point is a remote-tracking branch. Set the branch.autoSetupMerge configuration variable to false if you want git checkout and git branch to always behave as if --no-track were given. Set it to always if you want this behavior when the start-point is either a local or remote-tracking branch.
