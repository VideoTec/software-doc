下载时，使用 git --bare 更合适

Mirroring a git repository without a local copy
If you haven’t cloned the repository before, you can mirror it to a new home by

$ git clone --mirror git@example.com/upstream-repository.git
$ cd upstream-repository.git
$ git push --mirror git@example.com/new-location.git

This
will get all the branches and tags that are available in the upstream repository and 
will replicate those into the new location.

Don’t use git push --mirror in repositories that weren’t cloned by --mirror as well. 
It’ll overwrite the remote repository with your local references (and your local branches). 
This is not what we want. 
Read the next section to discover what to do in these cases.

Also git clone --mirror is prefered over git clone --bare 
because the former also clones git notes and some other attributes.
