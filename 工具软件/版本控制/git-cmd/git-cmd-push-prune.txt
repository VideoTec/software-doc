不理解这个选项的意思？会删除远程分支吗？

--prune
Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart. 

For example 

a remote branch tmp will be removed 
if a local branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. 

This also respects refspecs, 
e.g. 
git push --prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/* 
would make sure that remote refs/tmp/foo will be removed 
if refs/heads/foo doesn’t exist.
