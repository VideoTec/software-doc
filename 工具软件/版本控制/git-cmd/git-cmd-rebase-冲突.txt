When you perform a git rebase operation, you're typically moving commits around. Because of this, you might get into a situation where a merge conflict is introduced. That means that two of your commits modified the same line in the same file, and Git doesn't know which change to apply.

After you reorder and manipulate commits using git rebase, should a merge conflict occur, Git will tell you so with the following message printed to the terminal:

$ git rebase develop
When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort".

$ git rebase --continue
src/com/feinno/beside/ui/activity/help/AllHelpFragment.java: needs merge
src/com/feinno/beside/ui/activity/help/SelectedHelpFragment.java: needs merge
You must edit all merge conflicts and then
mark them as resolved using git add
