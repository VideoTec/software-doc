upstream 概念
git branch -vv 列出所有分支的upstream

git push -u origin my_branch  
上传分支，并且，设置当前分支的upstream branch

git branch -u origin/develop  
git branch -set-upstream-to origin/develop
Branch develop set up to track remote branch develop from origin

git checkout -b libav10 libav/release/10   建立了pull关系
git checkout --track libav/release/10  创建release/10分支

fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match

    git push origin HEAD:develop

    git push origin dev

The upstream branch of your current branch
does not match the name of your current branch.  

To push to the upstream branch on the remote, use：xxxx

$ git push
fatal: The current branch 11 has no upstream branch.

the first time that you push that branch. 
You only need to do it once, and that sets up the association between your branch and the one at origin in the same way as git branch --set-upstream does
