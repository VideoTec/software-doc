First, what is the result of git branch -a on machine B?
Second, you have already deleted 'heads/devel' on 'origin', 
so that's why you can't delete it from B.

Try
git branch -r -d origin/devel
or
git remote prune origin
or
git fetch origin --prune

git push public :master

This would delete the remote branch named master as Kent Fredric has pointed out.

To list remote-tracking branches:
git branch -r

To delete a remote-tracking branch:
git branch -rd public/master
