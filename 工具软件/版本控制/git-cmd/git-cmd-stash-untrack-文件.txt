Warning, doing this will permanently 
delete your files if you have any directory/* entries in your gitignore file.

Add (git add) the file and start tracking it. 
Then stash. Since the entire contents of the file are new, 
they will be stashed, and you can manipulate it as necessary.

As of version 1.7.7 you can use git stash save -u to stash untracked files without staging them.
