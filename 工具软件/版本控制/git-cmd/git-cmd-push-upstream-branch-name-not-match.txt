$ git push
fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match
the name of your current branch.  To push to the upstream branch
on the remote, use

    git push origin HEAD:2014_Q4_20150109

To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

    git push origin q4

To fix the warning once and for all, rename your local branch to match the remote name:
git branch -m releases/rel_5.4.1

参考：push.default
simple - must reject a push when branch names are different. 
in centralized workflow, work like upstream with an added safety to refuse to push if the upstream branch’s name is different from the local one.
