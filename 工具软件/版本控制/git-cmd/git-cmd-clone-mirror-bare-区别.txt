--mirror 可能会比 --bare 多下载一些分支信息（远程库里的 远程分支）

--bare
Make a bare Git repository. 
That is, 
instead of creating <directory> and placing the administrative files in <directory>/.git, 
make the <directory> itself the $GIT_DIR. 
This obviously implies the -n because there is nowhere to check out the working tree. 
Also the branch heads at the remote are copied directly to corresponding local branch heads, 
without mapping them to refs/remotes/origin/. When this option is used, 
neither remote-tracking branches nor the related configuration variables are created.

--mirror
Set up a mirror of the source repository. 
This implies --bare. 
Compared to --bare, --mirror 
not only maps local branches of the source to local branches of the target, 
it maps all refs (including remote-tracking branches, notes etc.) and 
sets up a refspec configuration such that 
all these refs are overwritten by a git remote update in the target repository.
