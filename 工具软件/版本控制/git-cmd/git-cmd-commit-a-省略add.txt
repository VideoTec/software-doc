2）可以删除文件
3）重命名，也不能恰当处理。

git commit -am "my commit message"

The “git commit -a” command is a shortcut to a two-step process. 
After you modify a file that is already known by the repo, 
you still have to tell the repo, 
“Hey! I want to add this to the staged files and eventually commit it to you.” 
That is done by issuing the “git add” command. 
“git commit -a” is staging the file and committing it in one step.

If you create a new file, edit it, 
and issue the “git commit -a” command, you will see something like:

The “nothing added to commit but untracked files present” is the key comment. 
Git even suggests using “git add” to track the file. 
See, it’s user friendly.
Just be aware.
