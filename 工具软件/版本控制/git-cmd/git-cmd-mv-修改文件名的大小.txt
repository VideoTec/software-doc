Starting git 2.0.1 (June 25th, 2014), a git mv will just work on case insensitive OS.

See commit baa37bf by David Turner (dturner-tw)

mv: allow renaming to fix case on case insensitive filesystems
"git mv hello.txt Hello.txt" on a case insensitive filesystem always triggers "destination already exists" error, because these two names refer to the same path from the filesystem's point of view, and requires the user to give "--force" when correcting the case of the path recorded in the index and in the next commit.

Detect this case and allow it without requiring "--force".
git mv hello.txt Hello.txt just works (no --force required anymore).

例子：

wangxiangfx@wangxiangfx MINGW64 /e/testgit2 (master)
$ git mv Lowcase.txt lowcase.txt

wangxiangfx@wangxiangfx MINGW64 /e/testgit2 (master)
$ git status
