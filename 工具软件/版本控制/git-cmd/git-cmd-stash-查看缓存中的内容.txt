git stash list
stash@{0}: WIP on feature/foo
stash@{1}: WIP on feature/bar
stash@{2}: WIP on fix/baz

All those stashed changes have their own reference (like branch names) 
that you can look at, like stash@{0}, stash@{1}, etc.
Above, we looked at stash@{0} which is the default for stash actions.

指定 stash 引用号
git stash show stash@{1} -u

The following will give you the diff of the topmost stash item:
git stash show -u
