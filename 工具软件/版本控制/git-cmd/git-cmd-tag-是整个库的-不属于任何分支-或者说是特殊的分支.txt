标签（固定指向一个提交）和分支（可在分支上添加新的提交）的区别

From the theoretical point of view:

tags are symbolic names for a given revision. They always point to the same object (usually: to the same revision); they do not change.

branches are symbolic names for line of development. New commits are created on top of branch. The branch pointer naturally advances, pointing to newer and newer commits.
