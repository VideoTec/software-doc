Git servers typically listen on TCP port 9418.

Remote file store and shell access
A Git repository can be cloned to a shared file system, 
and accessed by other persons. 
It can also be accessed via remote shell 
just by having the Git software installed and allowing a user to log in.

Git daemon, instaweb
Git daemon allows users to share their own repository to colleagues quickly. 
Git instaweb allows users to provide web view to the repository. 
As of 2014-04 instaweb does not work on Windows. 
Both can be seen in the line of Mercurial's "hg serve".
