$ git config alias.q '!sh -c "echo a; echo b"'

$ git q
Output:

a
b

I think this is (rudimentarily) documented in man git-config under alias.*

Note that git commands should include git, 
unlike in normal aliases. 
It is caused by fact that it is treated as a shell command, 
not as a git command (see manpage quoted in the question). 

For example to chain

git init

and

git commit --allow-empty -m "empty initial commit"

it is necessary to create

"!git init; git commit --allow-empty -m \"empty initial commit\""

alias.
