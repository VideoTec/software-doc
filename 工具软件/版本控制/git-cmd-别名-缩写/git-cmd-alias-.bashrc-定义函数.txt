Building off of @Gavin's answer:

Making lazygit a function instead of an alias allows you to pass it an argument. 
I have added the following to my .bashrc (or .bash_profile if Mac):

function lazygit() {
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "$1"
    git push
}
This allows you to provide a commit message, such as

lazygit "My commit msg"
You could of course beef this up even more by accepting even more arguments, 
such as which remote place to push to, or which branch.
