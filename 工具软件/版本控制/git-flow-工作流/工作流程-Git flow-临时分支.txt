Supporting branches 
Next to the main branches master and develop, 
our development model uses a variety of supporting branches 
to aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, 
prepare for production releases and to assist in quickly fixing live production problems. 
Unlike the main branches, 
these branches always have a limited life time, since they will be removed eventually.

The different types of branches we may use are:

Feature branches
Release branches
Hotfix branches

Each of these branches have a specific purpose and 
are bound to strict rules as to 
which branches may be their originating branch and 
which branches must be their merge targets. 
We will walk through them in a minute.

By no means are these branches “special” from a technical perspective. 
The branch types are categorized by how we use them. 
They are of course plain old Git branches.
