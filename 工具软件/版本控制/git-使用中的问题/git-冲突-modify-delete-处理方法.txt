Removed file conflicts occur when 
1）one person edits a file, and 
2）another person deletes that file in their branch. 
Git does not know if you want to 
1）keep the file with the new edits, or 
2）delete the file and forget about those edits. 
This example will show how to resolve this both ways.

Resolving a removed file conflict

第一种解决方法: keep the file with the new edits
第二种解决方法：delete the file and forget about those edits

The conflict message:

CONFLICT (delete/modify): res/layout/dialog_item.xml deleted in dialog and modified in HEAD
means that res/layout/dialog_item.xml was deleted in the 'dialog' branch you are merging, but was modified in HEAD (in the branch you are merging to).

So you have to decide whether

remove file using "git rm res/layout/dialog_item.xml"
or

accept version from HEAD (perhaps after editing it) with "git add res/layout/dialog_item.xml"
Then you finalize merge with "git commit".

会增加一个 “合并” 提交 - 
Note that git will warn you that you are creating a merge commit, in the (rare) case where it is something you don't want. Probably remains from the days where said case was less rare.
