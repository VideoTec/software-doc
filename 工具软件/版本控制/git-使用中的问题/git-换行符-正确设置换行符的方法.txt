http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081607/what-is-the-best-git-config-set-up-when-you-are-using-linux-and-windows/6081812#6081812

As detailled in Git on Windows (msysgit) - Unix or DOS line termination, I would use:

git config --system core.autocrlf false
That would avoid any automatic eol transformation 
(See "Git on Windows: 
What do the crlf settings mean?" for the exact meaning of this option value).

You can leave it to true, 
as explained in git replacing LF with CRLF, 
but I prefer setting core.eol + some gitattribute files 
in order to fine tune some of the files I want eol changes on.
See this answer for more details.
