Unlink of file '.git/objects/pack/old-53564d31e7e67290f48a6b950b15c88232f373c5.pack' failed. Should I try again? (y/n)

重启电脑后还出问题

I had this issue and solved it by the command : git gc 
The above command remove temp and unnecessary files. (Garbage collector.)

不知道是那个程序占用的那个文件，只好重启电脑解决的。

That usually means a process is still using that specific file (still has an handle on it)
(on Windows, ProcessExplorer is good at tracking that kind of process)

Try closing your other programs, and try again your git pull.
