Meld doesn't show differences in line endings in file view, 
but files with different line endings 
are shown as being different in directory and VC views

[Ubuntu] Ignore Line Ending Differences in the Meld Tool
Recently I upgraded my Ubuntu VM to 10.04.02 amd64. 

The Meld tool, version 1.3.0, 
deals with the line ending differences in file view, 
while the version 1.1.5.1 (in my previous 08.04 32-bit Ubuntu VM) doesn’t show such differences.

Usually I need to compare files with the same name 
but different line endings 
(One is checked out from version control of Linux and the other is from Windows). 

I’d like to make CRLF and LF compare equal.

Solution:

Edit -> Preferences -> Text Filters -> 
New a patten with a name something like 
“line ending” and 
regex “\r+$” and check the Active check box. 

Refresh or restart the Meld.
