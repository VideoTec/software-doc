-t <tool>
--tool=<tool>

Use the merge resolution program specified by <tool>. 
Valid values include 
1）emerge, 
2）gvimdiff, 
3）kdiff3, 
4）meld, 
5）vimdiff, and 
6）tortoisemerge. 

Run git mergetool --tool-help for the list of valid <tool> settings.

If a merge resolution program is not specified, 
git mergetool will use the configuration variable merge.tool. 
If the configuration variable merge.tool is not set, 
git mergetool will pick a suitable default.

git config --global merge.tool p4merge
git config --global mergetool.p4merge.cmd p4merge '$BASE' '$LOCAL' '$REMOTE' '$MERGED'
git config --global mergetool.p4merge.trustExitCode false

You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool 
by setting the configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.path. 
For example, 
you can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting mergetool.kdiff3.path. 
Otherwise, git mergetool assumes the tool is available in PATH.

Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs, 
git mergetool can be customized to run an alternative program 
by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.cmd.

When git mergetool is invoked with this tool 
(either through the -t or --tool option or the merge.tool configuration variable) 
the configured command line will be invoked with 

1）$BASE 
set to the name of a temporary file containing the common base for the merge, 
if available; 

2）$LOCAL 
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file 
on the current branch; 

3）$REMOTE 
set to the name of a temporary file containing the contents of the file 
to be merged, and 

4）$MERGED 
set to the name of the file to 
which the merge tool should write the result of the merge resolution.

If the custom merge tool correctly 
indicates the success of a merge resolution with its exit code, 
then the configuration variable mergetool.<tool>.trustExitCode can be set to true.
 
Otherwise, 
git mergetool will prompt the user 
to indicate the success of the resolution 
after the custom tool has exited.
