git config --global mergetool.keepBackup false 
meld 有效；
kdiff3 无效;

[merge]
    tool = meld         上面的命令，是加在这个字段里
    keepBackup = false  这个对 meld 有效；kdiff3 需要单独设置

                        问题：是 [merge] 字段，还是 [mergetool]字段？
[mergetool "meld"]
    prompt = false
    keepBackup = false
    keepTemporaries = false 注意 ： kdiff3 保存备份文件的单独设置 不是这里
    path = C:/Program Files (x86)/Meld/meld/meld.exe
    cmd = '\"/c/Program Files (x86)/Meld/meld/meld.exe\" $PWD/$LOCAL $PWD/$BASE $PWD/$REMOTE --output=$PWD/$MERGED'

kdiff3 保存备份文件的单独设置：
kdiff3 菜单 | Settings | Configure KDiff3... | Directory | Backup files (.orig)
勾掉 Backup files (.orig) 就可以了。

15:48 2015/12/11 走的弯路：
kdiff3 勾掉 Backup files (.orig) 设置后，.orig 还是出现。
原来是，git reset --hard 后，没有 git clean -fdx，那个 .orig 是之前产生的。

A possible solution from git config:

git config --global mergetool.keepBackup false

After performing a merge, 
the original file with conflict markers can be saved as a file with a .orig extension.

If this variable is set to false then this file is not preserved.
Defaults to true (i.e. keep the backup files).
The alternative being not adding or ignoring those files, as suggested in this gitguru article,

git mergetool saves the merge-conflict version of the file with a “.orig” suffix.
Make sure to delete it before adding and committing the merge or add *.orig to your .gitignore

Charles Bailey advises in his answer 
to be aware of internal diff tool settings which could also generate those backup files, 
no matter what git settings are.

kdiff3 has its own settings (see "Directory merge" in its manual).

other tools like WinMerge can have their own backup file extension 
(WinMerge: .bak, as mentioned in its manual).
So you need to reset those settings as well.
