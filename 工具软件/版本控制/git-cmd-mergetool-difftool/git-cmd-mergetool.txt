git-mergetool - 
Run merge conflict resolution tools to resolve merge conflicts

git mergetool [--tool=<tool>] [-y | --[no-]prompt] [<file>…​]

Use git mergetool to run one of several merge utilities to resolve merge conflicts. 
It is typically run after git merge.

If one or more <file> parameters are given, 
the merge tool program will be run to resolve differences on each file 
(skipping those without conflicts). 

Specifying a directory will include all unresolved files in that path. 
If no <file> names are specified, 
git mergetool will run the merge tool program on every file with merge conflicts.
