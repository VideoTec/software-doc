REST & HTTP API developer's pocket knife. Easy to use and configurable. HATEOAS, Hypermedia, Requests History+Repository, and more.
[Please scroll down for permissions explanation]

DHC by Restlet is designed and developed by developers for developers to make direct HTTP/REST resource discovery, manipulation and testing easier. DHC by Restletâ€™s main functions include: 

API invocation and interaction
Through an intuitive browser interface, make calls to APIs to validate their functional behavior, testing different parameters and values without writing a program or script.

API testing
Create and run unit tests as well as complete testing scenarios for APIs, with conditional logic and parametrization. These tests can be added to a Maven or Jenkins CI/CD toolchain.

Key features:
  - Call web APIs through a visual tool
  - Save calls history, locally or to the cloud, and organize it in projects
  - Build dynamic requests with custom variables, security and authentication 
  - Analyze and validate responses, compare them to history
  - Combine multiple API requests into test scenarios with conditional logic and variables
  - Share work with colleagues
  - Integrate API testing to CI/CD toolchain through plugins for Maven and Jenkins

DHC by Restlet is part of the Restlet platform: the first API Platform as a Service with a comprehensive and integrated set of capabilities for API developers.


Why DHC requires "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit" and "Communicate with cooperating websites" permissions?

Chrome applications which need access to internet resources must declare it in their manifest. It can be a list of URLs or URL mask; e.g. http://*/* allowing access to any URL. 

Allowing access to any URL is a primary function of DHC, and the URL mask with wildcards is in interpreted by Chrome Store as:

This app can access:
Read and change all your data on the websites you visit

Which is true, but doesn't mean that the app is doing something bad. DHC doesn't collect your data.

Why 'Communicate with cooperating websites' permission? 

DHC is available also as a service. This permission allows data exchange  between DHC Service and DHC Chrome. This feature is disabled by default.
