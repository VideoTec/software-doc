可能通过 reset-sync data 来实现这个需求。

Having trouble with sync or your passphrase?
Reset sync to clear your data from the server and remove your passphrase. 
This will not clear data from your devices.
Sign back in to Chrome to start syncing.

重置同步数据时，会登出浏览器。
再次登录，会把本地的数据同步到服务器

Google hasn't fixed this issue yet, but there is one way around it.

So far, this is the only way to remove a device from the “Other Devices” 
list on the new tab page. You'll have to use Google Chrome for Android to achieve your goal:

Launch Google Chrome on an Android device.
Go to "Other Devices".
Long press on the device you wish to remove.
Click the "Remove" button.
