Overview

XVI32 is a freeware hex editor running under Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP/Vista/7. The name XVI32 is derived from XVI, the roman notation for the number 16. XVI32 and all of its components are developed by myself.
The current release 2.55 is available since June 26, 2012. It comes with a complete online help and requires only 1.02 MB of hard disk space. There is no setup program needed - just unzip the downloaded archive to your hard disk! XVI32 doesn't write any data to your registry.

XVI32 is used by thousands of people all over the world. It was included in books like the Hacker's Guide. Even people at Microsoft â„¢ do use XVI32! If you don't believe me, look at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/835840/EN-GB/.

Features

XVI32 has the following main features. Especially note the highlighted advantages of XVI32.
