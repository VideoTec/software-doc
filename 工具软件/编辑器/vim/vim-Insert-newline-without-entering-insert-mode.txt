添加新行，但不是进入插入模式

Insert newline without entering insert mode

As you all may know with 'o' or 'O' you can insert a new line after/before the current line. 
But both commands enter the insert mode, which may sometimes not be what you want. 
I put this in my vimrc-file to insert a new-line after the current line by pressing Enter 
(Shift-Enter for inserting a line before the current line):

nmap <S-Enter> O<Esc>
nmap <CR> o<Esc>

If you want to stay in the line where you have been before use the following maps:

nmap <S-Enter> O<Esc>j
nmap <CR> o<Esc>k
