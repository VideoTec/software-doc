The command :Explore opens the file explorer window.

Select a file or directory name and press Enter to open that file or directory.

To return to the explorer window, press Ctrl-^ (usually Ctrl-6).

You can also "edit" a directory to explore that directory. For example, :e .. lists files in the parent directory.
In normal mode, type :e then press Space and Ctrl-D. That will list file names in the current directory. You can type a name and press Enter to edit that file.

If, for example, you want a name that starts with "get" type :e get then press Tab repeatedly, or Ctrl-D to list all matches.
