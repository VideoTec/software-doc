非正常关闭文件时，会出现下面的提示：

(1) Another program may be editing the same file.
    If this is the case, be careful not to end up with two
    different instances of the same file when making changes.
    Quit, or continue with caution.

(2) An edit session for this file crashed.
    If this is the case, use ":recover" or "vim -r mainfrm.c"
    to recover the changes (see ":help recovery").
    If you did this already, delete the swap file ".mainfrm.c.swp"
    to avoid this message.


swap file ".mainfrm.c.swp" already exists!
[]pen Read-Only, (E)dit anyway,(R)ecover, (D)elete it, (Q)uit, (A)bort:

需要手动删除这个文件才行。
ls -a 才能看到 .mainfrm.c.swp

出现这个提示的原因有两个：
See the VIM recovery manual entry. You shouldn't be seeing these files normally, unless

your VIM instance is crashing
you're inadvertently running two VIM instances against the same file
I quite often do the latter, running 2 VIMs against the same file, in two terminals, without realising it. The 'swap file' message is the indicator that I'm doing this.

Perhaps you've got a VIM session running (backgrounded?) that you've forgotten about ?
