you start up two Vim programs and copy text from one to another.
You do this by using the system Clipboard register (“*).

And "+ is a special register that refers to the system clipboard
In Windows, the Clipboard can be accessed with "*; so the command to copy till end of file becomes "*yG

"* or "+ - the contents of the system clipboard

"/ - last search command
": - last command.

Special registers:
            '"' the unnamed register, containing the text of
                the last delete or yank
            '%' the current file name
            '#' the alternate file name
            '*' the clipboard contents (X11: primary selection)
            '+' the clipboard contents
            '/' the last search pattern
            ':' the last command-line
            '-' the last small (less than a line) delete
            '.' the last inserted text
                            *c_CTRL-R_=*
            '=' the expression register: you are prompted to
                enter an expression (see |expression|)
                (doesn't work at the expression prompt; some
                things such as changing the buffer or current
                window are not allowed to avoid side effects)
                When the result is a |List| the items are used
                as lines.  They can have line breaks inside
                too.
                When the result is a Float it's automatically
                converted to a String.
