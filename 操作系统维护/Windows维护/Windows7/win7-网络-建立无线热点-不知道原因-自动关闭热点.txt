Does your laptop goes into sleep mode in that time? 
Because the hotspot turns off with the wifi during sleep mode. 
After awake, 
it doesn't turn on automatically. 
I use hotspot regularly in my laptop,
and it doesn't turn off even after long hours given the laptop doesn't sleep and 
the wifi hardware stays on.

Which way you use for creating WiFi hotspot in your laptop? 
If you set your computer sleep time, hotspot will stop after computer sleep.  
You had better check your computer setting. 
I think you can use WiFi hotspot creator, 
which won't make your computer sleep. And it has timer. 
You can set shut down time for computer.
