DIR /S | MORE
where the MORE command accepts DIR's Standard Output at its own Standar Input, 
chops the stream in blocks of 25 lines (or whatever screen size you may use) and sends it to its own Standard Output.

(Since MORE's Standard Input is used by DIR, 
MORE must catch its keyboard presses (the "Any Key") 
directly from the keyboard buffer instead of from Standard Input.)
