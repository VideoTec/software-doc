解释：

1）
The magic variables %n contains the arguments used to invoke the file: 
%0 is the path to the bat-file itself, 
%1 is the first argument after, 
%2 is the second and so on

2）
Since the arguments are often file paths, 
there is some additional syntax to extract parts of the path. 
~d is drive, 
~p is the path (without drive), 
~n is the file name. 

They can be combined so ~dp is drive+path.
%~dp0 is therefore pretty useful in a bat: 
it is the folder in which the executing bat file resides.

You can also get other kinds of meta info about the file: 
~t is the timestamp, 
~z is the size.

完整列表：
Substitution modifiers for for variable references have been enhanced. The following table lists optional syntax (for any variable I).
%~I         - expands %I removing any surrounding quotes ("")
%~fI        - expands %I to a fully qualified path name
%~dI        - expands %I to a drive letter only
%~pI        - expands %I to a path only
%~nI        - expands %I to a file name only
%~xI        - expands %I to a file extension only
%~sI        - expanded path contains short names only
%~aI        - expands %I to file attributes of file
%~tI        - expands %I to date/time of file
%~zI        - expands %I to size of file
%~$PATH:I   - searches the directories listed in the PATH
               environment variable and expands %I to the
               fully qualified name of the first one found.
               If the environment variable name is not
               defined or the file is not found by the
               search, then this modifier expands to the
               empty string
