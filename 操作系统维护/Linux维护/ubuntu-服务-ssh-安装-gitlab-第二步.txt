Bash Scripts
----------------------------------------

These bash scripts are the quickest — if not the most robust — way to install a packagecloud repo. 
They'll detect your platform and architecture and setup the repo accordingly. 
If necessary, they'll also install the gpg key that we use for repo signing.

First, pick an install script for your platform. 
Then, you can choose to either pipe it to sudo bash or curl it and do something else, 
depending on your level of paranoia.

curl -s https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
