nc10 启动进入 BIOS ： F2

一些重要步骤：

1）Erase disk and install ubuntu
   默认设置的分区：
   partition #1 of SCSI1(0,0,0) as ext4
   partition #5 of SCSI1(0,0,0) as swap
   
   这个磁盘叫做： (sda)

2) 设置用户名，机器名，及密码
   Your Name: wangxiang
   Your Computer Name: ubuntu-nc10
   Pick a username: wx
   psw: y
   
   选中：
   require psw to login and encrypt my home folder
   
3) 开始安装复制文件，完成后提示
   restart now 
   这个时候，可以拔掉 u 盘吗？ 可以拔掉（而且应该拔掉）

安装完成后重启，设置

The following tutorial will teach Ubuntu users 
how to encrypt their home folder after installation, for enhanced security.

Step 3 – Setting up your passphrase and completing the encryption process

Now hit the CTRL+ALT+F7 key combination to return to the login screen. 
Log in with your normal user and wait for the encryption passphrase information window to appear. 
Click the "Run this action now" to record your passphrase, 
in case you will need to recover your files at a later time. 
Write your passphrase in your head or somewhere safe!

That's it! You can now safely reboot your machine and log back in into your newly encrypted Ubuntu session.

I happened to get the Message again now, after an update:

Record your encryption passphrase

To encrypt your home directory or "Private" folder, a strong passphrase has been 
>automatically generated. Usually your directory is unlocked with your user password, but 
>if you ever need to manually recover this directory, you will need this passphrase. 
>Please print or write it down and store it in a safe location. If you click "Run this action now", 
enter your login password at the "Passphrase" prompt

and you can display your randomly generated passphrase. 
Otherwise, you will need to run "ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase" from the command line to 
>retrieve and record your generated passphrase.

So ecryptfs-unwrap-passphrase is the answer
